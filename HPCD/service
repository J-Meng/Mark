Directory-Service
#It is used to get user account information.

#src/directory/user_info.py
#user_info
 First get UserLimits, then create "my_map" obj for response.

#add_free_plan_for_user
 If user has no plan, which means user_subscription_cf has no record, insert one free record into the user_subscription_cf for the user.

(look the subscription plan as the sku)


#get_user_active_sku
 First, take a short of the cql sentence: "select sku_id, expiration from user_subscription_cf where user id = '%s' order by expiration desc;"
 It will get sku_id sort by expiration desc. So the free plan will be the first result.
 Then it judge if results count == 1, use the free plan/sku_id, else if count of results > 2 records, use the second record.(skip the first free plan)

#get_subscription_plan
 Just get sku/plan's state and plan name through sku_id

#get_subscription_status
 Route for('/subscription/<userid>/status'). Which return a dict include plan information
