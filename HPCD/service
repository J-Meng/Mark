--------------------------------------
Directory-Service
#It is used to get user account information.

--#src/directory/user_info.py
#user_info
 First get UserLimits, then create "my_map" obj for response.

#add_free_plan_for_user
 If user has no plan, which means user_subscription_cf has no record, insert one free record into the user_subscription_cf for the user.

(look the subscription plan as the sku)


#get_user_active_sku
 First, take a short of the cql sentence: "select sku_id, expiration from user_subscription_cf where user id = '%s' order by expiration desc;"
 It will get sku_id sort by expiration desc. So the free plan will be the first result.
 Then it judge if results count == 1, use the free plan/sku_id, else if count of results > 2 records, use the second record.(skip the first free plan)

#get_subscription_plan
 Just get sku/plan's state and plan name through sku_id

#get_subscription_status
 Route for('/subscription/<userid>/status'). Which return a dict include plan information

--#src/directory/login.py
#login
 Route for('/login'), redirect to the app.config[SNAPFISH]['authorization_url']

#logout...validate....callback_function

#token
 Check..request..
 Then Check authorization if not 'bearer'
 Get refresh_token from swp
 Return access_token and refresh_token

--#src/directoty/usermgmt
 #user_service
 Judeg if config has delete_enabled or clear_enable. Then return the json.

 Some user operation such as:
	remove_alias.. 
	delete_user.. 
	clear_user..
	clear_filestorage-- use celery(julep.jobs.clear_storage)
	clear_metadata..

This service mainly do the task such as query metadata by ES, delete device by ES,etc.

--#longisland/jobs.py
 store. also will call julep.jobs.update_metadata_by_checking_thumbnail




--------------------------------

Storage Service

How does a document upload? What's the flow?
(For example, we call files_put method, check.. , verify..., then connect to swift, upload through swift_put_object method, then write cassandra-->means insert metadata to cassandra by ES, add record into swift_directory_cf)

Thumbnails also put into swift by swift_put_object method
