    As last two week's training, I have a broadly understanding about our drive project. But still need more deeply study for taking the job smooth.

First we have 8 web services in the drive project. So first step, I'll make clear of the jobs by all the services do, and what is important that how do these

services interact with storage-service. I'll read/understand the code where storage-service interact to other services.

    Second step, as we use Mock for the unit-test. I'll learn about Mock to write test case and have a quick look at Nose of python. try more practices.

    Third one, Understand how does queue works in the HPCS. Like task queue by celery or message queue by RabbitMQ.

    The fourth step,  with the NoSQL in system. Including using Cassandra, ElasticSearch.

    Then look through the storage code again maybe this time can have a lot gains.

    --------time line--------
    1. Figure out the interactions between storage-service and other services.   Maybe 5 days.  
    2. Unit-Test.   3 days.
    3. Queue jobs.  3 days.
    4. NoSql.  3-4 days.
    5. View the code again or maybe take some practices such as do a feature refer to Group 1 did or anything else?...  5 days.
